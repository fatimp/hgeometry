HGeometry
=========

HGeometry is a library for computing with geometric objects in
Haskell. It defines basic geometric types and primitives, and it
implements some geometric data structures and algorithms. The main two
focusses are:

- 1. Strong type safety, and
- 2. implementations of geometric algorithms and data structures that
have good asymptotic running time guarantees.


TODO: Say s.t. about backpack usage



Please note that aspect two, implementing good algorithms, is much work in
progress. Only a few algorithms have been implemented, some of which could use
some improvements.
