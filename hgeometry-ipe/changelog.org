#+title: Revision history for HGeometry-ipe
#+STARTUP: showeverything

* 1.0 [Unreleased]

- Updated for compatibility with HGeometry 1.0

* 0.14 [unreleased] Only on github

- ~DefaultFromIpe~ instance for rectangles
- Support for Text attributes
- Update to use hgeometry 0.15.

* 0.13

- Newer BezierSpline parsing.
- Renamed the modules from ~Data.Geometry.Ipe~ to simply ~Ipe~. The
  following find and sed command should be able to help you migrate
  (but use it at your own risk)

  #+begin_src sh
  find src -name "*.hs" -exec sed -i -e 's/Data.Geometry.Ipe/Ipe/g' {} \;
  #+end_src
- Better Documentation; i.e. specific reexports from the Ipe module.
- Added functionality to load and add a stylesheet to a file.
- Added support for the stroke-opacity attribute.
- IpeRender and IpeToIpe modules that allows to us to easily call
  'iperender' and 'ipetoipe'. The IpeToIpe module now also defines a
  'wirteIpeFileAsPdf' function that allows us to write to an ipe pdf
  file (by calling ipetoipe to create this pdf.)

* 0.12

- Compatibility with HGeometry 0.12

* 0.11
- Split the Types module into smaller sub modules, and restricting
  what is exported.
- Traversable, Foldable, and Functor instances for the ipe types.
- Reading and Writing of Ellipses :)
- Added Coordinate Float and IpeWriteText Float instances.
- readAll now accepts only one IpePage rather than a Foldable f => f
  (IpePage r)
- Renamed attrLens to ixAttr, and added a prism _Attr to access an
  attribute._
- added convenience functions (well, Getter's) for getting all Ipe
  objects on a particular layer, or in a particular view.
- readSinglePageFile now makes sure there is at least one layer / view
  in the file, and if not creates it. This matches the behaviour of
  ipe itself. See the new 'withDefaults' function in the Types module
  for the details.
- fromContent now creates these layers and views as well.

* 0.10

- Added a 'labeled' IpeOut that supports labeling geometric objects
  with some textual label
- IpeWrite instance for NonEmpty Lists, and IpeWriteText and
  Coordinate instances for Data.RealNumber.Rational

* 0.9

- First release in which hgeometry-ipe was split off from hgeometry.
